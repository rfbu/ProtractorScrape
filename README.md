# ProtractorScrape
scraping practise using protractor on amazon.com.au
I am using page object so that I don't repeat myself and also async await.
I am also chaining element with child element. 
Note that I'm using locator() in the child element

one known issue: I am not getting the product type(hardcover, kindle e.t.c.) consistently. Am still trying to figure that out.
